Brisk is a macOS app for filing [Radars](http://radar.apple.com) and
optionally crossposting them to [Open Radar](http://www.openradar.me/).

Brisk is written in Swift and uses
[Sonar](https://github.com/br1sk/Sonar) to communicate with Apple's
Radar web "APIs".

Brisk supports two factor auth, attachments, and saving radars as
drafts.
